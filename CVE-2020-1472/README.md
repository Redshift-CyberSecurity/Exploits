# cve-2020-1472
# PoC code taken from https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472 who have done a fantastic job on this write up. #RealSlick
# Updated to include exploit code which dumps hashes from teh DC after setting the password as well as the latest impacket release to pull off the sploitage
# Probably should get your own copy of impacket from https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/ . Which is yet another awesome sauce piece of work.
# run "python zerologon.py <hostname> <ip>" to exploit
# run "netdom resetpwd /s:localhost /ud:<domain>\<account> /pd:*" on the dc and restore the machine password
